# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

With this project, I wanted to make a workday calendar that had time blocks colored according to the hour of the day. You may also enter text into the time blocks on my scheduler and save it locally so you can access it whenever you'd like. At the top of the screen will also be the current date.

## Install

No install needed; please visit [Work Day Scheduler](https://orellanab5.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/) to access.

## Use

You can enter text between each block with a labeled time and the save button after clicking the aforementioned link. After entering text, save your entry by clicking the save button. The text should stay if you reload the page or navigate away from it and then return via the provided link.
